# Rapid-Data-Explorer
This Repository Consists of Classes Designed to perform a preliminary data analysis of any dataset.

Initially, the repository consists of a single class file called Rapid Data Explorer in eda.py that builds box plots of categorical columns. It also has helper classes to convert categorizal fields to numerical and split datefields into year, month etc.

The repository will continue to be built with additional features and plots including covariance graphs, scatter plots etc. that will make it easier to get a quick view into the data.
